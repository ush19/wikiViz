# wikiViz

##  Inspiration 
The inspiration for this project was drawn from [@terrence.png](https://www.tiktok.com/@terrence.png) on TikTok who maps two Wikipedia pages to each other with only the page's content and context. Combined with my interest in network science, I thought it'd be interesting to build a program to build the connections from nodes (Wikipedia pages) and the links which would lead from Wikipedia page A to Wikipedia page B. 

##  Goals
- Calculate the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages, if any. 
- Return degrees of separation between Wikipedia pages if such a path exists.

##  Future Considerations
- Fix direction of network graph to go specifically from A --> node --> node --> B, instead of A --> node --> node <-- B (currently algorithm works in the latter direction)
- Further develop network visualization from degrees of separation
- Reduce scope of links by removing links which aren't in the direct Wikipedia article
- Simplify how nodes are combined from searches A and B
