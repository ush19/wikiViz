bulk of this project was done by day 6 or so; however, I was unable to understand how to escape nested loops (two breaks) and keep values in a dictionary after clearing the value list (deepcopy) â€“ both resolved the past Monday. Figuring out the logic was also quite confusing, especially with recursion and nested loops, as well as the internal dilemmas on if I should build things from scratch or use already built modules. It's always the little things.
